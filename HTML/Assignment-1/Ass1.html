    <h1>Until I Found You</h1>
    <p>Georgia, wrap me up in all your love</p>
    <p>I want you, in my arms</p>
    <p>Oh, let me hold you</p>
    <p>I'll never let you go again, like I did</p>
    <p>Oh, I used to say</p>
    <p>"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"</p>
    <p>I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"</p>
    <p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>
    <p>I found you</p>
    <p>I found you</p>
    <p>I found you</p>
    <p>Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to...</p>
    <p>Love her, once again</p>
    <p>You fell, I caught you</p>
    <p>I'll never let you go again, like I did</p>
    <p>Oh, I used to say</p>
    <p>"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"</p>
    <p>I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"</p>
    <p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>
    <p>I found you</p>
    <p>"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"</p>
    <p>I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"</p>
    <p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>
    <p>I found you</p>
